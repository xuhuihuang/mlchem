Jupyter Notebook Tutorials for Machine Learning in Chemistry (MLChem) 
==============================================================================================================================

This website hosts the Jupyter Notebook gallery for the undergraduate course Machine Learning in Chemistry (MLChem), first offered at the University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison in Spring 2025 as CHEM 361, taught by `Prof. Xuhui Huang <https://huang.chem.wisc.edu/>`_. In this course, results from applying ML methods to chemical datasets were generated directly from executable Jupyter notebooks used in the lecture slides. These notebooks have been compiled into an online gallery with Sphinx. Each notebook is a self-contained tutorial that can be viewed as a rendered webpage or run interactively in Google Colab. The corresponding lecture slides are also embedded within each notebook.
